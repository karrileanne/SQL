#For this project, I used SQL to query the Superstore database to get information about items sold at the store and their prices.

#Use a SELECT statement to order the items by price.
SELECT item_name,price
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price ASC;

#Show a statistic about the item prices.
SELECT SUM(price)
FROM superstore;

#Show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies". 
SELECT MAX(price),category
FROM superstore
WHERE category='Kitchen Supplies';

-- Which category has the most profit?
SELECT category, price
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price DESC;
